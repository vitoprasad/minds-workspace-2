# Service icons

Brand marks for the services latchkey can connect to, keyed by latchkey
canonical service name (`<service_id>.svg`). Used by the Permissions tab's
service marks.

These are each vendor's own artwork, in the vendor's own colors. Nothing here
is recolored, and nothing may be: several of these brands publish usage rules
that forbid altering their logo's colors. A mark that cannot be seen on the
dark theme's black surface gets a *second file* instead, `<service>-on-dark.svg`,
which is a separate vendor-published white variant of the same logo — never a
tinted copy of the first.

Because the artwork carries its own color, it must be drawn as an `<img>`
(`ServiceMark.ts`, `.service-mark-img` in `frontend/src/style.css`) and never
inlined into the page. A CSS mask keeps only the alpha channel and would throw
the color away, and inlining `notion-mcp.svg` under a `fill: currentColor` ancestor
would repaint it — it pairs a white path with a deliberately unfilled one.

## Provenance

Most marks come from two Iconify icon sets, copied verbatim from their npm
packages. Each file is an icon body from the set, wrapped as a standalone SVG
document with the icon's own `viewBox`; no path data is authored here. Four
marks (`ngrok`, `ramp` and their `-on-dark` variants) instead come straight
from the vendor's own published brand kit, because no vetted set carries them
-- see the press-kit section of `ATTRIBUTION.md`.

The press-kit files carry the vendor's artwork unaltered, with two mechanical
normalizations so they behave like the rest of the set: fixed root
`width`/`height` attributes become the equivalent `viewBox` (ngrok), and a CSS
`class` + `<style>` fill becomes the same fill written directly on the path
(Ramp). Path data and colors are byte-identical to the vendor's files.

Calendly and Umami have no color artwork in either Iconify set — both are
`palette: false` everywhere they appear — so they keep the flat simple-icons
silhouette the whole set used to be. Their fill is written into the file
(Calendly `#006BFF`, Umami `#000000`, each brand's own color as simple-icons
records it) because an `<img>`-loaded SVG inherits no color from the page: left
implicit, both would paint black.

Several of the vendor marks are single-color because that is how the brand
draws them — GitHub, Linear, Sentry, Dropbox, Discord and Yelp in their brand
ink, Claude in its coral, Coolify in its purple, ngrok and Ramp in near-black.
That is the brand's choice, not a monochrome treatment applied here.

## Adding a mark

Drop `<service_id>.svg` in, using the vendor's published artwork. Add
`<service_id>-on-dark.svg` only if the mark is illegible on black *and* the
vendor publishes a white variant — do not make one by recoloring. A service
with no file falls back to a plain glyph in the Permissions tab (every current
catalog service has one). `service_icons_test.py` pins
which marks are single-color and which ship a dark-surface variant, so a file
swapped for a fill-less silhouette fails there rather than shipping invisible.
