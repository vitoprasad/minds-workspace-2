/**
 * The composer's combo card: which PROVIDER this chat runs on, and which model on it.
 *
 * The provider leads, because with several accounts signed in it is the first thing worth
 * knowing about a chat.
 *
 * Everything it shows is data: the static per-harness catalog from HarnessCatalog.ts, the
 * agent's live `model_choice` pushed onto the agents store, and its `account` label resolved
 * against the account list. Which rows show is decided by the matched catalog option (effort
 * iff the model declares more than one; fast iff it supports it); the switch mode decides
 * whether they are interactive.
 *
 * The provider row is the one that always renders. A provider is a property of the ACCOUNT,
 * not of the model, so it survives all three of the states in which there is no model to show.
