"""The chat app's workspace-wide settings: the fast mode a new chat starts in, whether the user has been
told, and whether a new chat picks its model by how hard the work looks.

One small JSON file beside the chat app's other state (``data/.apps/chat/settings.json``),
read on every use so an edit from another process lands without a restart, and written whole.
``path`` None keeps the settings in memory, for tests and a manager built with no workspace.
