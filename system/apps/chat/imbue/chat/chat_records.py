"""The chat record store: which agents a chat has run on, in order (``docs/system/blueprint/chat-agent-split/`` 4.2).

A record exists only for a chat that has had a handoff; a chat with no record is its one agent
(the own-chat rule). Records live under ``data/.apps/chat/chats/<chat_id>/record.json``, written
atomically under a per-chat lock, with the accounts index's version discipline: a record from a
newer build refuses to load rather than being read wrong. The store sits behind a small interface
so the manager reads records the same way whether they come from disk or, in tests, from memory.
