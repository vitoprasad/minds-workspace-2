"""The handoff: continuing a chat on another harness (``docs/system/blueprint/chat-agent-split/`` section 5).

A handoff converges the chat's active agent, archives it, and creates its successor with a
summary. Its whole working state lives on the chat record's ``handoff`` entry, and every step
re-checks reality before acting, so a chat-app restart at any point resumes by running the
steps again: each one either finds its work done or does it. The runner here owns the steps;
the manager owns the record, the lock, and the tracked agents, and hands the runner what it
needs as bound callables (``HandoffDeps``), the same shape the harness sessions take.

The phases, in order: ``draining`` (wait out an in-flight send, return the queue to the
composer), ``summarizing`` (reuse a fresh summary or ask the retiring agent for one; skipped
outright for a retiring agent that never received a user turn), ``switching`` (stop, archive,
record the segment's length, create the successor silent, apply the model the user picked for
it, deliver the handoff prompt as its first message, then the held sends), then active again
with the ``agent_switch`` chip between the two segments. A create or a model pick that fails
leaves the chat in the ``failed`` phase, which a retry runs the failed step of again: the
successor is created under a pre-minted id, so a retry after a failed pick adopts it rather
than creating another.
