# run_automation.sh -- wake a singleton "automation agent" for one scheduled run.
#
# An automation agent is a once-per-cadence agent that runs a single skill: it is
# created once, kept alive across runs (never destroyed/recreated), and on each
# run has its chat cleared and its skill re-triggered in place. The weekly
# Caretaker is the canonical example (`run_automation.sh caretaker`), but the same
# machinery drives any skill on any cadence -- e.g. a morning news agent
# (`run_automation.sh news`) -- so adding one is just: write a skill and schedule
# this script. See the manage-scheduled-tasks skill.
#
# Usage:
#   run_automation.sh <skill> [--template <template>] [--type <harness>] [--agent-name <name>]
#                              [--no-clear]
#
#   <skill>          Required. Names the skill to run: the agent is messaged
#                    `/<skill>` on every run and found as a singleton by the
#                    `automation=<skill>` label.
#   --template <t>   Create template for the agent (default: `automation`, an
#                    agent oriented to run the named skill). The Caretaker
#                    passes its own tailored template (`caretaker`).
#   --type <h>       Agent type (harness) to run on. Without it the agent runs on
#                    the workspace's default provider account and its harness,
#                    from .mngr/settings.local.toml; naming one here gets that
#                    harness but no account unless the default account is on it.
#   --agent-name <n> Agent name shown in the UI (default: the skill name).
#   --no-clear       Keep the agent's chat instead of clearing it first. Use for
#                    an agent that answers a stream of user requests rather than
#                    running one scheduled job: the clear-then-trigger pair costs
#                    about 90 seconds (two chat sends, one settle wait), which is
#                    most of the latency such an agent's user feels, and a warm
#                    context is what makes their follow-up message make sense.
#                    Only safe for a skill that re-reads its own state each run.
#
# Invoked by the weekly caretaker job (the entry the enable-caretaker skill
# creates, via system/libs/automations/run_job.sh and system/services/caretaker/caretaker_check.sh) or any
# other cron entry, through
# system/libs/automations/with_agent_env.sh so it runs from the repo root (/home/user/workspace) with the
# services agent's environment (MNGR_HOST_DIR, MNGR_AGENT_ID, ... -- cron
# scrubs the env otherwise).
#
# On each run:
#   - No agent yet (first run ever) -> create the persistent agent whose first
#     message is `/<skill>`. A brand-new agent starts from an empty chat, so a
#     self-detecting skill (like caretaker) can deliver a first-run welcome.
#   - Agent already exists -> send `/clear` to start a fresh session, then
#     send `/<skill>` to run again with a clean context. Both go through the
#     chat app (system/scripts/message_chat.py), which addresses the agent's
#     chat by id, revives a stopped agent on send, and falls back to
#     `mngr message` itself when the chat app cannot take the message.
#
# `/clear` starts a new session, so the skill re-runs with no memory of the
# previous run -- it re-detects first-run state, re-reads its own files, etc.
# The clear resets the agent's context (what the next run reasons from), which
# is what makes each run genuinely fresh.
